## URLify
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string. Please use a character array so that you can
perform this operation in place.
## Example
Input: "Mr John Smith"
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
